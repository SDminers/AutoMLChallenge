This directory contains an example of sample submission for the ChaLearn AutoML challenge. 

- The metadata file must be included and remain unchanged. 

- The directory structure and naming should remain unchanged.

- The subdirectory res/ may contain results (for result submission)

- The code was tested with Anaconda 2.0 | Python 2.7 by Continuum Analytics.

- To create a valid submission, zip all the file with:
		zip -r zipfilename *
starting from this directory, i.e. do not zip the directory itself, just its contents.
The directory may also be zipped by turning on the flag 
zipme = True
in run.py

- For zipfilename use something explicit to remember the nature of its contents (algorithm name, code version, etc.)
